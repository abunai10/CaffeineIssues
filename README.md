# Caffeine Issue Tracking
This repository is made for Caffeine developers and users to have a central repository to submit and track progress on bug reports.

With Discord tickets being private, we had users reporting the same problem multiple times (often in DMs or tickets), while here everyone can see all active issues.

Please utilize the below templates when submitting issues for tracking. Issues that do not have enough relevant information will be closed.
